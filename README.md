# Text-To-Speech Python Script with Google Cloud

This is a Python-based text-to-speech application that reads text from a text file and converts it into an audio file (MP3) using Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API. The generated audio files are saved with unique filenames to avoid overwriting.

## Features:
- Converts text from a text file into speech.
- Supports Google Cloud's natural-sounding voices.
- Saves audio output with unique filenames to avoid overwriting.

---

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Google Cloud Python Client Library: Install it using:
  ```bash
  pip3 install google-cloud-texttospeech
- Google Cloud Service Account Credentials.

# Part 2: Script Conguration.

Replace these paths in the scriptÂ before running:
- Google Cloud Credentials: credential_path = "/Users/yourname/demofile/authorization.json" # Replace with your desired JSON key path
- Input Text File: text_path = "/Users/yourname/demofile/textfile.txt"  # Replace with your desired text file path
- Output Audio Folder: output_folder = ""/Users/yourname/demofile/audiofiles" # Replace with your desired output folder

Notes:
Keep the JSON file private (avoid committing it to public repos).
Ensure the path in your code matches your local file location.
