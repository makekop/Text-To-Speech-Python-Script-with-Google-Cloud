# Text-To-Speech Python Script with Google Cloud

This is a Python-based text-to-speech application that reads text from a text file and converts it into an audio file (MP3) using Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API. The generated audio files are saved with unique filenames to avoid overwriting.

---

## Features:
- Converts text from a text file into speech.
- Supports Google Cloud's natural-sounding voices.
- Saves audio output with unique filenames to avoid overwriting.
---

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Google Cloud Python Client Library: Install it using:
  ```bash
  pip3 install google-cloud-texttospeech
- Google Cloud Service Account Credentials.

# Configuration
1. **Google Cloud Service Account**

- Follow the setup guide from the [google_cloud file](../main/google_cloud/README.md) to enable the API and create a service account.
- Save the JSON file locally (e.g., `authorization.json`).

2. **Edit the credential path in `CloudSpeechflask.py`:**

```python
credential_path = "/your/local/path/authorization.json"
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = credential_path
```

# Script Conguration:

Replace these paths in the scriptÂ before running:
- Google Cloud Credentials: credential_path = "demofile/authorization.json" # Replace with your desired JSON key path
- Input Text File: text_path = "demofile/textfile.txt"  # Replace with your desired text file path
- Output Audio Folder: output_folder = "demofile/audiofiles" # Replace with your desired output folder

Notes:
Keep the JSON file private (avoid committing it to public repos).
Ensure the path in your code matches your local file location.

## **Environment Configuration**  
You may set your environment variable differently depending on your operating system:  

### **MacOS/Linux:**  
Add the following line to your terminal or shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`):  
```bash  
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/authorization.json"  
```  
Then run:  
```bash  
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile depending on your shell  
```  

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly in the Python script:  
```python  
import os  
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/your/authorization.json"  
```  

### **Windows (Command Prompt):**  
Run the following command in Command Prompt:  
```cmd  
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\path\to\your\authorization.json  
```  

Or in PowerShell:  
```powershell  
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\authorization.json"  
```  

Alternatively, set it directly in the Python script:  
```python  
import os  
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\authorization.json"  
```  

---

## **Running the Script:**  
Once you have configured the paths and set the environment variable, you can run the script directly within your code editor or you can run the saved Python script by its filename with:  
```bash  
python text_to_speech.py  
```  

---

## **Example Output:**  
The script will read the text from your specified text file, convert it to speech using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API, and save the output as an MP3 file in the specified folder.  
The saved file will have a unique filename (e.g., `output.mp3`, `output_1.mp3`, etc.) to prevent overwriting.  

---

## **requirements.txt:**  
The `requirements.txt` file can be found in the repository:  

```
google-cloud-texttospeech==2.15.0
```

To install the dependencies, run:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
