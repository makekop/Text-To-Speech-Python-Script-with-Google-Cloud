Markus the man, the myth, the legend amongst many, many other things. You might have heard of him in the past, but you might not know all of the heroic and noble things he has done in his life. Many tell stories of him being a mythical character, but he humbly refers to him self as "Just a regular dude, with highly above average understanding and view of the world, with good looking face, muscular almost a divine body". One of the things you might have heard is that he once gave his kidney to a stranger in need and not only that, he performed the surgery himself to save the governments money on public healthcare. He was quoted after the surgery. "I was only trying to do what's right" Sadly we have no more stories we can share at the moment as Markus wants to keep his good samaritanity anonymous for the bigger audiences. However you can contact himself via linkedin.com/in/markuskoponen/ and ask for more information on his humbleness and kindness towards the mankind and Mother Nature.
